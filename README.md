# ðŸ‘¾ Operationalize of Machine learning model


This application is a Machine Learning Microservice API that predicts housing costs in Boston based on certain features. It uses a pre-trained "sklearn" model to make these predictions. The API is built using a Python Flask app that provides API calls to deliver predictions (inference) about the housing prices. The API is provided in a file called "app.py."  You may read more about the data on [the data source site] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing), which was where the original Kaggle data came from. This project demonstrates the ability to operationalize a machine learning model as a microservice API, and it could be extended to include other pre-trained machine learning models for different purposes such as image recognition or data labeling.

## Usage

#### clone my-project with git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aderounmu/udacity-operationliaze-ml.git

cd udacity-operationliaze-ml
```

#### Create the venv
```bash
  make setup  
```
this creates a hidden virtual environment folder for python

#### Activate venv
```bash
  source ~/.devops/bin/activate
```

#### Install dependencies
```bash
  make install
```

#### Lint application
```bash
  make lint
```


#### Run docker container
```bash
    chmod u+x run_docker.sh
  ./run_docker.sh
```

#### Upload to docker hub
```bash
    chmod u+x upload_docker.sh
  ./upload_docker.sh
```

#### Run in kubernetes
```bash
    chmod u+x run_kubernetes.sh
  ./run_kubernetes.sh
```


#### Test API endpoint optional

```bash
    chmod u+x make_prediction.sh
  ./make_prediction.sh
```
